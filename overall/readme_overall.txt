Certainly! I'll break down this assignment step by step and then provide you with a high-level code structure as expected. Let's go through this systematically:

Step 1: Project Setup and Environment
1. Set up a new Python project
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install necessary dependencies

Step 2: LLM Integration
1. Choose a local or quantized LLM (e.g., LLaMA, BLOOM)
2. Set up vllm or ollama to host the chosen LLM
3. Create a wrapper class for LLM interactions

Step 3: Multi-Agent System
1. Choose between AutoGEN and Crewai for multi-agent functionality
2. Implement the core multi-agent system structure
3. Define different agent roles (e.g., Researcher, Writer, Analyzer)

Step 4: API Integrations
1. Implement ARES API integration for real-time internet search
2. Create a YouTube video processing module
   - Implement YouTube search functionality
   - Develop video transcription and summarization capabilities

Step 5: Content Extraction
1. Develop modules to extract text and images from various sources
2. Implement a module to process and analyze extracted content

Step 6: Task Processing Pipeline
1. Create a main task processing pipeline
2. Implement task parsing and agent assignment logic
3. Develop result aggregation and formatting functionality

Step 7: User Interface
1. Choose between Gradio and Streamlit for the interface
2. Design and implement a simple UI for user input and result display

Step 8: Documentation and GitHub Upload
1. Write clear setup and usage instructions
2. Create a comprehensive README.md file
3. Upload the entire project to GitHub
================================================================================================================

Here's a brief explanation of the major changes and additions:

The self keyword has been removed, and the code now uses standalone functions instead of class methods.
The main.py file now includes both the FastAPI server setup and the Streamlit UI initialization.
The agent_manager.py file contains the core logic for processing tasks and coordinating between agents.
Each agent (researcher, writer, analyzer) has its own file with specific implementation details.
The llm_wrapper.py file provides functions for initializing and using the local LLM.
API integrations for ARES and YouTube are implemented in separate files.
Content extraction functions are provided for text and image extraction from web pages.
The Streamlit UI is implemented in streamlit_app.py.

To fully implement this project, you'll need to:

Set up your local LLM and update the path in llm/llm_wrapper.py.
Obtain API keys for ARES and YouTube, and set them as environment variables.
Fine-tune the agent logic in each agent file to better handle specific types of tasks.
Implement error handling and rate limiting for API calls.
Add logging throughout the application for better debugging and monitoring.
Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce API calls.
Add unit tests for each component to ensure reliability.

Remember to follow best practices for code organization, error handling, and API design throughout the implementation.


===============================================================================================================

THE FLOW OF THE PROJECT and what's happening at each stage:

Project Initialization:

When the application starts, it loads the environment variables from the .env file.
The FastAPI application is initialized in main.py.
The local LLM is initialized using the initialize_llm() function in llm/llm_wrapper.py.


User Interaction:

Users interact with the system through the Streamlit UI (ui/streamlit_app.py).
They enter a task description in the text input field and click the "Process Task" button.


Task Processing:

The user's task is sent to the FastAPI endpoint /process_task.
The process_task() function in agents/agent_manager.py is called.


Agent Determination:

The determine_agents() function analyzes the task description to decide which agents should be involved (researcher, writer, analyzer).


Agent Execution:

For each selected agent, the execute_agent_task() function is called with the appropriate agent function (research, write, or analyze).


Research Agent:

If the researcher agent is selected, it performs the following steps:
a. Searches the web using the ARES API (api/ares_api.py).
b. Searches YouTube for relevant videos (api/youtube_api.py).
c. Extracts text and images from top web results (content_extraction/extractor.py).
d. Transcribes the top YouTube video if available.
e. Summarizes the findings using the local LLM.


Writer Agent:

If the writer agent is selected, it:
a. Generates an outline for the task using the local LLM.
b. Creates content for each section of the outline.
c. Generates a conclusion.


Analyzer Agent:

If the analyzer agent is selected, it:
a. Generates key analysis points using the local LLM.
b. Evaluates strengths and weaknesses related to the task.
c. Provides recommendations based on the analysis.


Result Combination:

The combine_results() function in agent_manager.py aggregates the outputs from all involved agents.


Response to User:

The combined results are sent back to the Streamlit UI.
The UI displays a summary of the results and provides detailed information for each agent's output.


Continuous Operation:

The system continues to listen for new tasks from users.
Each new task goes through the same process, from user input to result display.



This flow allows the system to handle a wide range of tasks by leveraging different agents and external APIs as needed. The modular structure makes it easy to add new agents or capabilities in the future.
Key Points:

The system is designed to be flexible, allowing it to handle various types of tasks without needing to change the core structure.
The use of a local LLM allows for quick text generation without relying on external AI services.
The integration of external APIs (ARES for web search, YouTube for video content) enriches the system's capabilities.
The Streamlit UI provides a simple, user-friendly interface for interacting with the complex multi-agent system.

To further develop this project, you might consider:

Adding more specialized agents for specific types of tasks.
Implementing a caching system to store and reuse common search results or LLM outputs.
Adding a feedback mechanism for users to rate the quality of the results, which could be used to improve agent selection and task processing.
Implementing a more sophisticated task parsing system to better understand user intentions.
Adding support for file uploads and processing (e.g., PDFs, images) to expand the system's capabilities.

This project structure provides a solid foundation for a flexible, extensible multi-agent system that can be adapted to various use cases and expanded over time.
